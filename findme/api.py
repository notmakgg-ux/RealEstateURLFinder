    Start the FINDME pipeline: URL Finder -> Email Crawler.

    1. Searches queries across DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Mojeek
    2. If `cities` is provided, queries with `{city}` expand across all cities
    3. If `pre_formed_queries: true`, queries are used as-is (no placeholders)
    4. Retries up to `max_retries` times if under `min_unique_results`
    5. Pushes URLs to Google Sheets as `{location}` tab
    6. If `email_crawler: true` (default), automatically crawls all found websites
    7. Email results write to `{location} Results` tab
    8. Summary saved to output/summary.txt
